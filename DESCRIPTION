Description: This package is developed to facilitate identification of metabolites in untargeted metabolomics studies. To do the deconvolution, we require that for every high collision energy scan there is a 0V collision energy scan. Based on the 0V scans we interpolate the abundance of the precursors and deconvolve mixed spectra based on the amounts of each precursor in each scan.
